# Lane B: the residue-extension input reduced to the cited Gabber theorem

The adapter
`Stafford38.Characteristic.CanonicalResidueExtensionSymbolControlAdapter`
already reduces `CanonicalResidueExtensionSymbolControl` to
`CanonicalMinimalPrimeInvolutivityOverFields`: involutivity of every minimal
prime of the order initial ideal of the *canonical* quotient, over an
arbitrary characteristic-zero field, with no scalar extension, algebraic
closure, or Laurent series in the statement.  Two gaps remained between that
proposition and the literature theorem it is supposed to instantiate.

* Gabber's theorem is about the radical `√Ann_S gr M`, not about the
  individual minimal primes of `Ann_S gr M`.
* Gabber's theorem is about an arbitrary finitely generated filtered module,
  so neither `0 < N` nor `IsPBWMonicAt` plays any role in it; the canonical
  right ideal `dA + x₀^N dA` is one instance among all right ideals.

This file closes both.  `WeylAssociatedGradedRadicalInvolutivity` is the
citation itself, stated for the repository's actual associated graded object:
for every characteristic-zero field `L`, every `A_m(L)`, and every right ideal
`I`, the radical of `Ann_{S} gr(A/I)` is involutive.  It is *intended* to
transcribe the algebraic form of Gabber's theorem proved for
almost-commutative `ℚ`-algebras with Noetherian associated graded
(Singh--Kumar, *On the Involutivity of the Characteristic Variety*,
Comm. Algebra 42 (2014), no. 8, 3607-3618, Theorem 5.1 with Theorems 4.1 and
4.2).
Two things make that transcription plausible: `A/I` is cyclic, so its
order-quotient filtration is good; and the right-module convention costs
nothing, because `A/I` is a left `Aᵒᵖ`-module, `gr(Aᵒᵖ) ≅ (gr A)ᵒᵖ = S` since
`S` is commutative, and the induced bracket only changes sign.

That this Lean proposition really says what the cited theorem says is a human
review obligation recorded in `docs/literature-assumptions.yaml`, not
something this file establishes.  In particular it rests on the repository's
own identification of `OrderAssociatedGradedModule` with `gr(A/I)` for the
differential-order filtration.

The chain proved here is
`WeylAssociatedGradedRadicalInvolutivity →`
`WeylOrderInitialRadicalInvolutivity →`
`RightWeylMinimalPrimeInvolutivity →`
`CanonicalMinimalPrimeInvolutivityOverFields →`
`CanonicalBaseRelativePoissonOverFields →`
`CanonicalResidueExtensionSymbolControl`,
every step trust-zero.  No Gabber-type statement is proved here; the first
proposition is a theorem-shaped interface a caller must still supply.

/-- **The cited Gabber theorem, stated on the repository's own associated
graded module.**  For every characteristic-zero field `L`, every Weyl algebra
`A_m(L)` with its differential-order filtration, and every right ideal `I`,
the radical of the annihilator of `gr(A/I)` is involutive.

`A/I` is cyclic, so its quotient filtration is good; this is therefore the
statement of Gabber involutivity, not a project-specific strengthening of it.
It is a theorem-shaped interface: no proof is asserted here. -/
