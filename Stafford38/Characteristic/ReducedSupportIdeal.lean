# The reduced order-characteristic ideal

This file isolates the commutative ideal carried by the reduced order
characteristic support.  It also records its contraction to the base
polynomial ring.  These definitions make the remaining base-relative Gabber
statement concrete; no Poisson-closure theorem is asserted here.
