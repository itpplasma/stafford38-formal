# The Artinian triangular trace calculation

This file formalizes the terminal finite-dimensional trace core used in
Singh--Kumar, Proposition 3.2.
After choosing a coefficient field in the commutative Artinian special fibre
and a basis adapted to powers of its maximal ideal, the action of a lifted
maximal-ideal element is strictly triangular.  The first-order commutator
calculation then represents the bracket-cofactor action as

`R + (ΘA - AΘ) + (BΓ - ΓB)`,

where `R` is strictly upper triangular.  Its trace is zero.  On the other
hand, the residue decomposition of that action is a scalar matrix plus a
nilpotent matrix.  In positive dimension and characteristic zero the scalar
must therefore vanish.

The faithful terminal theorem assumes only that the induced operator has trace
zero.  This is exactly what the source proves from equation (3.3); it does not
identify the correction terms with commutators of same-size matrices over the
coefficient field.  A stronger commutator-shaped corollary is retained as an
abstract convenience, but is not claimed to follow directly from the source.

This file does not construct the coefficient field or adapted basis, derive
the trace-zero operator from a square-zero module, or connect it to the
localized right Rees module.

/-- Faithful terminal trace calculation used by Proposition 3.2.

The source-specific work upstream proves that the induced operator `T` has
trace zero.  The coefficient-field decomposition gives `q I + U = T`, where
maximal-ideal multiplication makes `U` nilpotent.  Positive dimension and
characteristic zero then force `q = 0`.

This implication is correct, but Proposition 3.2 does not directly provide its
same-size coefficient-field matrix identity.  The source-specific adapter
should instead establish the zero-trace hypothesis of
`scalar_eq_zero_of_trace_identity`.
